'''
7.1 
Merge two sorted List, l1, l2 
'''

'''
7.2
LC 92
take a sinlgly linkedlist L and two integer s and f as arguemtns 
and reverse the order of the node from s to f, includisve, the number begin at 1
'''
'''
7.3 Test Cyclicity
LC141, LC142
'''

'''
7.4
given two linkedlist, there is a shared node, find that node
'''


'''
7.5
Extending on 7.4, where list may each or both have cycle, 
you may reutrn any node that appear in the overlap
'''

'''
7.6
Given a refernce to a single node, delete it in O(1)
'''

'''
7.7
Given a singly linked list and an integer k, write a program to remove the kth last element from the list
'''

'''
7.8
LC 83
given a sorted list contains duplicated, remove all duplicates, 

'''  

'''
7.9
Given a singly linkedlist, and a nonnegative integer k, 
and returns the list cyclically to the right by k

''' 


'''
7.10
LC328
l0 -> l1 -> l2 -> l3 -> l4 -> None
re-order it to:
l0 -> l2 -> l4 -> l1 -> l3 -> None
Even nodes come first, then odd 
'''

'''
7.11
Test weather a singly linkedlist is palindromic in O(N)
'''
    
'''
7.12
Given a singly linkedlsit and number k, reorder the list as:
(nodes < k) -> (nodes == k) -> (nodes > k)
'''

'''
7.13
Add two list based integer:
given l1 and l2 represent two integers, they might have different length
In both lists, least significant digit come first
